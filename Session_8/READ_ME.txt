# README: Visualization and Analysis of Student Data

This script contains a series of visualizations and analyses performed on a dataset of students, their study times, grades, and courses. Each visualization answers specific questions about the data and provides insights into trends and distributions. Below are the details of each task and its purpose:

---

## 1. Lineplot: Study Time by Student Name
- **Visualization**: A lineplot shows how study time varies across different students, with markers to indicate individual data points.
- **Purpose**: Identify the student with the highest study time.
- **Insight**: Edgar has the highest study time.

---

## 2. Histogram: Grade Distribution
- **Visualization**: A histogram with bins (`75-80`, `80-85`, `85-90`, `90-95`, `95-100`) displays the frequency of students' grades in each range.
- **Purpose**: Determine which grade range has the highest frequency of students.
- **Insight**: The grade range `85-90` has the highest frequency of students.

---

## 3. ECDF Plot: Grade Distribution
- **Visualization**: An ECDF plot shows the cumulative distribution of grades, with a vertical line at `85`.
- **Purpose**: Determine the percentage of students scoring less than `85`.
- **Insight**: The percentage of students scoring less than `85` is calculated using the data.

---

## 4. Stripplot: Grade Distribution by Course
- **Visualization**: A stripplot displays the spread of grades for each course.
- **Purpose**: Identify the course with the widest distribution of grades.
- **Insight**: The courses with the highest spread in grades are Python for Data Science and Cloud Computing.

---

## 5. Swarmplot: Study Time by Gender
- **Visualization**: A swarmplot shows the distribution of study time for males and females.
- **Purpose**: Determine which gender has a higher average study time.
- **Insight**: Females have the higher average study time.

---

## 6. Pointplot: Average Grade by Course
- **Visualization**: A pointplot shows the average grade for each course.
- **Purpose**: Identify the course with the highest average grade.
- **Insight**: The course with the highest average grade is Computer Vision.
