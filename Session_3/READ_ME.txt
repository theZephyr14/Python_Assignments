**Python for Data Science - Assignment 3**

This assignment involves creating a basic Course Registration System in Python, using three core classes: `Course`, `Student`, and `Registration`.

**Features**
1. **Course Class**: Handles course information and student enrollment, allowing students to be added, removed, and displayed.
2. **Student Class**: Manages individual student data, including course enrollment, grade assignment, and GPA calculation.
3. **Registration Class**: Acts as the main manager, overseeing course and student registrations.

**Tasks Overview**
- Implement `Course` for course details and enrollment.
- Create `Student` for personal information, course management, and grades.
- Develop `Registration` to centralize enrollment processes and display functions.
- Add GPA calculation to the `Student` class.

**Usage**
The system allows creation of student and course instances, enrollment management, and GPA calculation, with examples included for illustration.
